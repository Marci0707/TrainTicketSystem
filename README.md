# TrainTicketSystem
A C++ console application where you can mess around with a provided train schedule
The schedule itself is contained in a binary search tree where each node is a Day object which stores the trains departing on that day.There is also a cart where you can place your tickets if you would like to buy them. The tickets in the cart are in a Linked list where each node has a next and a data pointer, pointing to the next ticket and its own ticket data.
